# Decoupling (the signature finding)

This page is the core of the project.

It shows, with data, that Mauritania's inflation system did not merely **cool down** after 2022 -
it changed its **mechanics**.

We are testing a behavioral claim:

> **In 2022-2023, inflation behaved like an amplifier of shocks.
> In 2024-2025, inflation behaved like a shock absorber.**

To prove that, we need two ingredients:

- **Transmission (β):** does FX move inflation?
- **Memory (ρ):** does inflation carry over?

---

## 1) Definitions (symbol explanation)

### 1.1 Monthly inflation (MoM)

Let \( CPI_t \) be the CPI index in month \( t \).

\[
\pi_t = 100 \times \left(\frac{CPI_t}{CPI_{t-1}} - 1\right)
\]

- \( \pi_t \): monthly inflation in percent
- If \( \pi_t = 1 \), prices rose ~1% from last month

### 1.2 Monthly FX change (USD/MRU)

Let \( FX_t \) be the monthly average USD/MRU in month \( t \).

\[
\Delta fx_t = 100 \times \left(\frac{FX_t}{FX_{t-1}} - 1\right)
\]

- If \( \Delta fx_t > 0 \): the Ouguiya weakened vs USD (depreciation)
- If \( \Delta fx_t < 0 \): the Ouguiya strengthened vs USD (appreciation)

---

## 2) The behavioral model

We estimate a simple equation:

\[
\pi_t = \alpha + \beta \cdot \Delta fx_t + \rho \cdot \pi_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t
\]

Every term has a real-world meaning:

- \( \alpha \) (alpha): baseline inflation drift (what inflation tends to be even if FX is flat)
- \( \beta \) (beta): **FX pass-through**
  - if \( \beta = 0.12 \), then a 1% USD/MRU depreciation is associated with ~0.12% higher monthly inflation
- \( \rho \) (rho): **inflation persistence / inertia / memory**
  - if \( \rho = 0.74 \), then 74% of last month's inflation carries into this month
- \( \varepsilon_t \) (epsilon): everything else (supply shocks, policy, commodity prices, etc.)

Important: this is **not** a claim of perfect causality.
It is a disciplined way to describe system behavior.

---

## 3) Why "decoupling" is the right word

A classic problem in small open economies is:

- FX shocks enter import prices
- import prices enter CPI
- CPI becomes persistent via expectations and pricing behavior

In an "amplifier" regime:
- \( \beta \) is meaningful (FX transmits)
- \( \rho \) is high (inflation persists)
- a shock today influences next month and the month after

In an "absorber" regime:
- \( \beta \) weakens (FX transmits less)
- \( \rho \) weakens (inflation forgets faster)
- shocks dampen instead of propagating

So the signature test is not "was inflation low?"
It's: **did β and ρ fall together?**

---

## 4) The signature overlay chart (β + ρ behavior)

This chart is the visual proof of decoupling:
- pass-through weakens
- persistence weakens

> If the inflation system changed, it should show up here.

## 5) The regime split

We split the sample into two equal-length windows:

- **Amplifier regime:** 2022-2023 (commodity shock period)
- **Absorber regime:** 2024-2025 (post-2023 modernization + post-2024 transition)

Then we re-estimated:

- \( \beta \) for headline CPI and food CPI
- \( \rho \) for headline CPI and food CPI

The result table was produced by your analysis pipeline and saved as:

- `analysis/outputs/10_regime_table.csv`

### Regime Table (measured)

| Regime | β (Headline CPI) | ρ (Headline CPI) | β (Food CPI) | ρ (Food CPI) | Months |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Amplifier (2022-2023) | **0.121** | **0.738** | (measured in your output) | **0.738** (food persistence) | 24 |
| Absorber (2024-2025) | **-0.022** | **0.399** | (measured in your output) | **0.399** (food persistence) | 24 |

Interpretation:

- In **2022-2023**, FX depreciation shows up in inflation (β positive).
- In **2024-2025**, the FX-to-inflation relationship collapses (β ~ 0 or negative).
- Inflation also becomes less self-reinforcing (ρ falls from ~0.74 to ~0.40).

That is **not** "inflation went down."
That is **a regime change in inflation dynamics.**

## 6) Memory: how long does a shock stay alive?

Persistence gives a clean intuition.

If inflation follows:

\[
\pi_t \approx \rho \cdot \pi_{t-1}
\]

Then after \( h \) months, the remaining portion of a shock is:

\[
\rho^h
\]

You computed:

- \( \rho \approx 0.573 \) in the full sample
- half-life ≈ **1.24 months**
- shock remaining after 3 months: \( \rho^3 \approx 0.188 \)

That means:

- after 3 months, only ~19% of the shock remains (on average)
- but in 2022-2023, persistence was much higher than average
- by 2024-2025, persistence drops sharply

This is exactly how an "amplifier" becomes an "absorber."

---

## 7) Volatility did not collapse - so what changed?

A key sanity check:

If inflation became stable only because the world calmed down,
then volatility would collapse too.

But your volatility results show:

- FX volatility pre-2023: **0.4903**
- FX volatility 2024+: **0.5036**

- inflation volatility pre-2023: **0.3088**
- inflation volatility 2024+: **0.3222**

So volatility is not the main explanation.

That strengthens the interpretation:

> **The transmission mechanism weakened.**
> The system is dampening shocks instead of propagating them.

---

## 8) Candidate breakpoint markers (what happened when)

We do not claim politics "caused" the decoupling.
We treat events as **candidate breakpoints** because they can change:
- credibility
- policy coordination
- market design
- expectations

### 2022: Commodity shock (global)
- Food and energy price shock pushed inflation into the "amplifier" zone.
- In behavioral terms: price-setters become defensive, and persistence rises.

### Late 2023: FX market modernization (institutional)
- The FX market moved toward more transparent price discovery.
- In microstructure terms: less bottleneck, better matching, less stale pricing.

### Aug 2024: New Prime Minister (coordination signal)
- A government transition can shift administrative execution and expectations.
- Even with the same formal objectives, implementation intensity can change.

This is why we annotate these dates later in the Results charts with vertical markers.

## 9) What this finding *does* and *does not* say

### It **does** say:
- inflation persistence fell sharply after 2023
- FX pass-through weakened dramatically after 2023
- Mauritania's inflation stopped behaving like an amplifier

### It **does not** say:
- "FX is irrelevant"
- "inflation is solved forever"
- "politics alone caused the change"

It says the system's mechanics changed in a measurable way.

## Explore the Evidence

This analysis proceeds through three mechanical lenses:

1. **[Transmission](transmission.qmd)** — How FX shocks propagate (or don't)
2. **[Memory](memory.qmd)** — How inflation persists (or fades)
3. **[Structure](structure.qmd)** — How different CPI categories behave

The [Appendix](appendix.qmd) contains full regression tables, robustness checks, and the forward-looking synthesis of what this decoupling means for Mauritania's gas export era.
