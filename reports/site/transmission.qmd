# Transmission: The Dollar’s Shadow

Mauritania is a small open economy.  
That means its currency is not a background variable — it is a structural force.

This section answers one clear question:

> When the Ouguiya moves, do prices follow?

We measure this using **exchange rate pass-through (β)**.

## 1. What is Pass-Through?

Pass-through measures how much monthly inflation changes when the exchange rate changes.

Formally:

\[
\pi_t = \alpha + \beta \Delta FX_t + \varepsilon_t
\]

Where:

- \( \pi_t \) = monthly inflation  
- \( \Delta FX_t \) = monthly change in USD/MRU  
- \( \beta \) = pass-through coefficient  

Interpretation:

- β = 0 → FX has no inflation effect  
- β > 0 → depreciation raises inflation  
- β < 0 → system absorbs shock  

---

## 2. Rolling Pass-Through (24-Month Window)

Pass-through is not constant across time.  
We estimate β using rolling 24-month regressions.

## 3. Two Regimes Appear

The data clearly divides into two behavioral systems.

### Amplifier Regime (2022–2023)

From your regime table:

- **Headline β ≈ 0.12**
- Food β significantly higher
- High persistence (see next section)

This means:

A 1% depreciation in the Ouguiya translated into approximately 0.12% monthly inflation.

Shocks did not fade.
They transmitted.

This was the commodity spike era.
Global food and energy prices surged.
Inflation breached the 5.53% structural threshold identified in prior Mauritanian studies.

The system amplified shocks.

---

### Absorber Regime (2024–2025)

From your computed table:

- **Headline β ≈ -0.02**
- Food β collapsed
- FX shocks no longer mechanically transmitted

This is a structural break.

The Ouguiya still moved.
But inflation stopped responding mechanically.

The system absorbed shocks instead of propagating them.

## 4. Structural Markers Overlay

Below is the same rolling beta with political regime markers:

Vertical markers include:

- March 2020 – COVID shock
- August 2020 – PM Bilal appointment
- February 2024 – AU Chairmanship
- August 2024 – PM Mokhtar Ould Djay appointment

The behavioral break aligns most clearly with the 2023 FX platform transition and consolidates during the 2024 political reset.

---

## 5. Interpretation

This is not about low inflation.

It is about **elasticity**.

Between 2022 and 2023:

- The economy behaved like an amplifier.
- External shocks multiplied internally.

Between 2024 and 2025:

- The economy behaved like a shock absorber.
- External shocks dissipated.

This is the first pillar of the Great Decoupling.

Inflation did not just fall.  
Its reaction function changed.
