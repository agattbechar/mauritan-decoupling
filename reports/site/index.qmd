## Stability is not low inflation.  
## Stability is when shocks fade instead of multiplying.

Between February 2020 and December 2025, Mauritania experienced:

- A global pandemic shock  
- A historic 2022 food and energy spike  
- Institutional transitions at the executive level  
- A modernization of the foreign exchange market  
- The transition toward gas-exporting status  

Inflation did not merely rise and fall during this period.

It **changed behavior**.

This report studies whether Mauritania's inflation system shifted from an **amplifier of shocks** to a **shock-absorbing regime**.

## The Core Question

> Did Mauritania's inflation mechanism structurally change between 2020 and 2025?

More precisely:

1. Does USD/MRU exchange rate movement transmit into inflation?
2. With what strength?
3. With what delay?
4. And did that transmission weaken after institutional and FX market reforms?

We do not speculate.

We measure.

## The Data Window

**Start date: 2020-02**

We begin in February 2020 for disciplined reasons:

- It avoids transitional noise after the 2019 presidential inauguration.
- It captures the full COVID macro shock period.

**End date: 2025-12**

This includes:
- The 2022 inflation spike
- The 2023 FX platform modernization
- The August 2024 Prime Minister transition
- The first gas export period

The window is intentional.
It is clean.
It is reproducible.

## What We Measure

We analyze three core behavioral parameters:

### 1) Level  
The CPI index and its monthly and annual changes.

### 2) Transmission (β)  
How strongly exchange rate movements appear in inflation.

Mathematically:

$$
Inflation_t = \alpha + \beta \cdot FX_{t-k} + \varepsilon_t
$$

If β is large → inflation amplifies currency moves.  
If β shrinks → inflation becomes insulated.

### 3) Memory (ρ)  
Does inflation persist month to month?

$$
Inflation_t = \rho \cdot Inflation_{t-1} + u_t
$$

If ρ is high → inflation carries inertia.  
If ρ falls → the system forgets shocks faster.

This is not theoretical.
We estimate both.

## What This Site Demonstrates

- 2022 was an **amplifier regime**.
- 2024–2025 shows characteristics of a **shock-absorbing regime**.
- Transmission strength (β) collapsed.
- Inflation memory (ρ) declined.
- Shocks no longer cascade forward.

The result is not cosmetic.

It is structural.

## Why This Matters: A Rare Opportunity

**The absorber regime gives Mauritania a rare opportunity: gas revenue without the typical macro volatility.**

Resource exporters usually face a dilemma: windfall revenue creates appreciation pressure and inflation spikes. The economy becomes volatile precisely when it should be prospering.

Our findings suggest something different.

With FX pass-through near zero and inflation persistence falling, external shocks no longer transmit into domestic prices. The inflation mechanism has become insulated.

**This changes the calculus.**

The question is no longer whether the regime will persist — it is whether policymakers will use this stability to build inclusive growth.

Cheaper capital. Longer-term investment. Broader development beyond extraction. These become possible when macro risk structurally declines.

The data shows the system learned to absorb shocks. The question is what gets built with that foundation.
