# Data: What Was Measured

Every conclusion in this report rests on two primary datasets:

1. The USD/MRU exchange rate
2. The Mauritanian Consumer Price Index (CPI)

Nothing else is introduced without documentation.

---

# 1. Exchange Rate (USD/MRU)

### Source
Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM)  
Daily official USD/MRU exchange rate file (Excel format)

### Coverage
- Start: 2020-02-01
- End: 2025-12-19
- Frequency: Daily
- Currency: US Dollar vs Mauritanian Ouguiya (MRU)

---

## 1.1 Monthly Aggregation

Daily rates are converted into monthly averages:

$$
FX_{month} = \text{mean of daily USD/MRU during month}
$$

Monthly percent change:

$$
\Delta FX_t = \frac{FX_t - FX_{t-1}}{FX_{t-1}}
$$

This aligns frequency with CPI.

# 2. Consumer Price Index (CPI)

### Country
Mauritania, Islamic Republic of

### Observations in raw file
150 total series for Mauritania

These include:
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Annual
- Index levels
- Percent changes
- Weights
- Multiple COICOP categories

We strictly filter.

## 2.1 Baseline Selection Rules

To avoid mixing incompatible series, baseline CPI uses:

- FREQUENCY: Monthly
- TYPE_OF_TRANSFORMATION: Standard reference period (2010=100), Index
- COICOP_1999: All Items

Selected headline series:

MRT.CPI._T.SRP_IX.M

This is the official monthly headline CPI index.

---

## 2.2 Inflation Calculation

We compute inflation manually.

Monthly inflation:

$$
\pi_t = \frac{CPI_t - CPI_{t-1}}{CPI_{t-1}}
$$

Year-over-year inflation:

$$
\pi^{YoY}_t = \frac{CPI_t - CPI_{t-12}}{CPI_{t-12}}
$$

No precomputed percent changes are used.

# 3. COICOP Breakdown

Mauritania CPI is divided into 13 categories:

- Food and non-alcoholic beverages
- Housing, water, electricity, gas and fuels
- Transport
- Health
- Education
- Communication
- Recreation and culture
- Clothing and footwear
- Restaurants and hotels
- Alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics
- Furnishings and household maintenance
- Miscellaneous goods and services
- All Items

Each category has:

- Monthly index
- Weight series (monthly and annual)

These are used to measure:

- Category-specific pass-through
- Category-specific persistence
- Contribution to headline inflation

# 6. Why This Matters

The integrity of macroeconomic research depends on:

- Frequency alignment
- Series consistency
- Avoiding transformation mixing
- Transparent filtering

This dataset follows those principles.

The findings are not rhetorical.

They are mechanical.

The next section shows how those mechanics change over time.
