# Methodology: How the System Was Measured

This report is narrative in tone.

But the conclusions are mechanical.

Every claim rests on reproducible transformations and transparent statistical structure.

Nothing is inferred without measurement.

## 1. Data Window

**Period:** February 2020 – December 2025  
**Frequency:** Monthly  

Why February 2020?

- FX data availability begins 2020-02-01
- CPI monthly series aligned from 2020-M02
- Avoids transition noise immediately after 2019 presidential change
- Includes the full COVID and commodity shock cycle

---

## 2. Core Data Sources

### Exchange Rate (FX)

- Daily USD/MRU
- Aggregated to monthly average
- Monthly percentage change computed:

$$
\Delta FX_t = \frac{FX_t - FX_{t-1}}{FX_{t-1}}
$$

---

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)

Selected series:

- FREQUENCY: Monthly  
- TRANSFORMATION: Standard reference period (2010=100), Index  
- COICOP: All Items (headline)  
- Category-level indices (Food, Transport, etc.)

Inflation computed manually:

$$
\pi_t = \frac{CPI_t - CPI_{t-1}}{CPI_{t-1}}
$$

Year-over-year:

$$
\pi^{YoY}_t = \frac{CPI_t - CPI_{t-12}}{CPI_{t-12}}
$$

We do not rely on precomputed inflation.

We calculate it directly.

---

## 3. Exchange Rate Pass-Through (β)

The pass-through coefficient measures:

> How much inflation responds to FX movement.

Model:

$$
\pi_t = \alpha + \beta \Delta FX_t + \varepsilon_t
$$

Where:

- $ \pi_t $ = monthly inflation
- $ \Delta FX_t $ = monthly FX change
- $ \beta $ = pass-through sensitivity

Interpretation:

- β > 0 → FX depreciation increases inflation
- β ≈ 0 → weak transmission
- β < 0 → FX movement not transmitting in expected direction

---

### Rolling Estimation

To detect regime shifts, we estimate β over rolling 24-month windows.

Why 24 months?

- Long enough to stabilize regression
- Short enough to detect structural shifts

This produces time-varying β(t).

---

## 4. Inflation Persistence (ρ)

Inflation memory is estimated using AR(1):

$$
\pi_t = \alpha + \rho \pi_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t
$$

Where:

- $ \rho $ measures persistence
- $ 0 < \rho < 1 $ → inflation has memory
- $ \rho \approx 0 $ → inflation resets quickly
- $ \rho > 0.6 $ → strong inertia

---

### Half-Life of a Shock

Half-life measures how long a shock lasts:

$$
\text{Half-Life} = \frac{\ln(0.5)}{\ln(\rho)}
$$

Estimated result:

- Overall ρ ≈ 0.57
- Half-life ≈ 1.24 months
- After 3 months: $ \rho^3 ≈ 0.188 $

Meaning:

A typical shock loses 80% of its strength within three months.

But this was not constant over time.

Rolling ρ shows regime behavior.

---

## 5. Volatility Analysis

Volatility computed as rolling 6-month standard deviation:

$$
\sigma_t = SD(\pi_{t-5}, ..., \pi_t)
$$

Comparison:

- Pre-2023 FX volatility: 0.4903
- 2024+ FX volatility: 0.5036

- Pre-2023 inflation volatility: 0.3088
- 2024+ inflation volatility: 0.3222

Observation:

FX volatility did not fall.

But transmission weakened.

This is critical.

The shock size remained.

The system response changed.

---

## 6. Regime Definition

Two structural regimes identified:

### Amplifier Regime (2022–2023)

- β high
- ρ high
- Commodity shock period

### Absorber Regime (2024–2025)

- β near zero
- ρ lower
- Institutional transition period

These were defined using rolling coefficient averages:

## 7. Structural Break Markers

Charts annotate:

- March 2020 (COVID shock)
- April 2022 (BCM leadership shift)
- February 2024 (AU Chairmanship)
- August 2024 (New Prime Minister)
- April 2025 (Gas export phase)

These are not assumed causes.

They are contextual anchors for interpretation.

## 8. What This Methodology Does Not Claim

- No structural causality model
- No DSGE framework
- No VECM or impulse response modeling

This project measures:

Behavioral structure.

It tracks:

- Transmission strength
- Memory persistence
- Volatility interaction

And tests whether those mechanics changed.
